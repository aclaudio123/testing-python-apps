# test-tesing-python-apps

In this repo, we look at how to test Python web apps and a Store's REST API built with Flask, Flask-RESTful, and Flask-SQLAlchemy.
The goal is learning to write unit, integration, and system test for testing Python web apps and REST API. There is also a Python refresher course with exercises for a quick python refresher.
